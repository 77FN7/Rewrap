## Example sections ##

.EXAMPLE sections get some special treatment. The first line is assumed to be
code, so won't be wrapped. (PowerShell makes this assumption too, and when the
help is shown, adds `PS C:\>` to the beginning of the line and a blank line
after it.) Lines after that will be wrapped.

    # .EXAMPLE            ¦            ->      # .EXAMPLE            ¦
    #   Get-Greeting -name Sam                 #   Get-Greeting -name Sam
    #   Gets a greeting for "Sam"              #   Gets a greeting   ¦
                          ¦                    #   for "Sam"         ¦

Extra code lines can also be declared by starting them with `PS C:\>`. A line
starting with this won't be wrapped.

    # .EXAMPLE        ¦          ->      # .EXAMPLE        ¦
    #   PS C:\>$a = 123                  #   PS C:\>$a = 123
    #   PS C:\>$b = 456                  #   PS C:\>$b = 456
    #   PS C:\>$c = $a + $b              #   PS C:\>$c = $a + $b
    #                 ¦                  #                 ¦
    #   This line is still               #   This line is  ¦
    #   wrapped.      ¦                  #   still wrapped.¦


Other lines are processed as markdown, so large code or output sections can also
be indented 4 spaces.
