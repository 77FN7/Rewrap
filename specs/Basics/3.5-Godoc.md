> language: "go"

Comments in Go are wrapped to match to the rules of the godoc parser rather than
markdown. There are two simple rules.


Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.

    // paragraph one      ->      // paragraph  ¦
    // text       ¦               // one text   ¦
    //            ¦               //            ¦
    // paragraph two              // paragraph  ¦
    // text       ¦               // two text   ¦

Pre-formatted text must be indented relative to the surrounding comment text.

    // normal wrapped paragraph      ->      // normal wrapped  ¦
    // text            ¦                     // paragraph text  ¦
    //    preformatted {                     //    preformatted {
    //      text       ¦                     //      text       ¦
    //    }            ¦                     //    }            ¦
    // normal wrapped paragraph              // normal wrapped  ¦
    // text            ¦                     // paragraph text  ¦

Unlike in markdown:
* No blank line is required between a normal paragraph and indented code block.
* Any amount of indent (as little as a 1-space) is required for the indented
  code block, as opposed to 4 spaces.
