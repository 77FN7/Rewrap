Markdown has a few features. The first one is that paragraphs are separated by a
blank line.

This line has 2 spaces at the end. In this case it's treated as a line-break
within a paragraph in markdown.  
Therefore the line needs to be wrapped separately. The 2 spaces at the end of
the line also need to be preserved.
