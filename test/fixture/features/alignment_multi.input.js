/* When this multiline comment, that consists of just one line, gets wrapped, the later lines are indented to the same level as the '/*' of the first line. This is the default behavior. */

/* However this multiline comment consists of two lines.
   The second line is indented to the same level as the first, and so when rewrapping this comment, this precedent is followed and the 2nd, 3rd and 4th resulting lines are also indented the same amount. */
